                <h2 class="sub-content-1-heading">Vinicius Jr. helped Karim Benzema just as much as the No. 9 helped him</h2>
                <p class="sub-content-1-content">Without Vinicius Jr., Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema is not a lock to win the Ballon d‚ÄôOr for the 2021/22 season.

                    I know that sounds like a strong statement, but it isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs not that Benzema wouldn‚Äôt be capable of winning the honor without Vini. It‚Äôs just that, realistically, it would not happen.

                    Even after scoring over 40 goals, Benzema was still seen as being tied with two players with inferior statistics and resumes in Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane until Real Madrid neutralized them both in their victorious Champions League Final.

                    And then there were the likes of Robert Lewandowski and Kylian Mbappe, who put up the kind of numbers that would have made them more formidable Ballon d‚ÄôOr foes than the, quite frankly, overhyped Liverpool forward duo.

                    So it is then fair to say that without Vinicius Jr.‚Äôs breakout year, Benzema would have struggled to achieve the jaw-dropping numbers he reached ‚Äì career-best numbers, which is saying something given the career he‚Äôs had thus far.</p>

                <h2 class="sub-content-2-heading">Karim Benzema thanks Cristiano Ronaldo for key role in record-breaking Real Madrid season</h2>
                <p class="sub-content-2-content">Speaking in an interview with Onze Mondial, the Frenchman has revealed he studied Ronaldo‚Äôs game closely during their nine-year spell together in Spain and picked up a few useful tricks - albeit admitting that he will never match the achievements of the 37-year-old.

                He said: ‚ÄúWhen I watched him, I tried to understand everything he did: the goals, the shots, the passes, the ball controI. I dissected everything about Ronaldo. That‚Äôs why I can say: it‚Äôs impossible to achieve the same.‚Äù

                Benzema‚Äôs stunning form this season has seen the Frenchman put-forward his name for this year‚Äôs Ballon d‚ÄôOr gong. He has explained why he believes he has earned plenty of plaudits so far throughout the year and has revealed that he would be worthy of the accolade come the end of the year.</p>

                <h2 class="sub-content-3-heading">Former Real Madrid player joins Jurgen Klopp in disrespecting Karim Benzema</h2>
                <p class="sub-content-3-content">Karim Benzema has scored 44 goals with 14 assists in all competitions for Real Madrid this season. He has even scored 15 goals in the Champions League alone, making this one of the greatest campaigns in the history of football‚Äôs most prestigious club competition. Without him, Real would not even be in the final, lest we forget his back-to-back hat-tricks against PSG and Chelsea in the knockout rounds.

                He is clearly the Ballon d‚ÄôOr favorite. Nobody else should even be considered a candidate in comparison to Benzema.

                But it is amazing how quickly the biased and ignorant want you to forget Benzema‚Äôs marquee moments -or simply want you to gloss over the data.

                You can count Jurgen Klopp among the biased and former Real Madrid player Steve McManaman among the ignorant.

                Here is what Klopp said at the press conference before the game, regarding the Ballon d‚ÄôOr:

                ‚ÄúEither you are Ronaldo or Messi or you win the Champions League.‚Äù

                And here is what McManaman ‚Äì the guy who thinks Jordan Henderson is better than Toni Kroos ‚Äì said about the Ballon d‚ÄôOr:

                ‚ÄúMane or Salah could still win the Ballon d‚ÄôOr if Liverpool win tomorrow.‚Äù</p>

                <h2 class="sub-content-4-heading">Karim Benzema named 2021/22 UEFA Champions League Player of the Season</h2>
                <p class="sub-content-4-content">UEFA's Technical Observer panel have named Real Madrid's Karim Benzema as the 2021/22 UEFA Champions League Player of the Season.

                The French striker was a talismanic figure for Madrid as he drove them on to a record 14th European title, and his fifth since he joined from Lyon in 2009. Not only did Benzema hit double figures for Champions League goals in a single season for the first time in his career, his final tally of 15 earned him top spot in the competition scoring charts.

                Remarkably, a joint-record ten of those goals came in the knockout stage, beginning with a decisive late hat-trick against Paris Saint-Germain in the round of 16.

                All of Karim Benzema's 2021/22 goals
                He followed up with another treble away to Chelsea and then buried the extra-time winner to oust the holders in Spain, before a trio of goals against Manchester City in the semi-finals ‚Äì including the extra-time penalty that capped a jaw-dropping comeback.

                Although Benzema did not add to his haul in the final, he now stands joint third with Robert Lewandowski in the all-time European Cup goals table. "He gets better every day, like wine," his coach Carlo Ancelotti explained last month. "Every day he becomes an even better leader, and feels more how important he is for the team and for the club. We are really happy and lucky to have him."</p>
